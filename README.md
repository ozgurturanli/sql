# SQL (Structered Query Language)
The below notes are from my school.

MySQL (and other relational database management systems)

Some groups of data types:
- Integral types
- Floating point numbers
- Decimal numbers with a fixed number of decimal places
- Spatial data types
- Character strings
- Date and Time
- JSON

With the;
- integers, you should definitely remember INT from the start. INT is an integer that requires 4 bytes of memory.
- floating point numbers, you should remember either DOUBLE or FLOAT
- decimal numbers, either DECIMAL or NUMERIC
- character strings, you need VARCHAR and CHAR right from the start
- date and time types DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP
